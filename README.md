# raise-github-language-bar

This usescript raises the language statistics section of Github repositories to the second position so that you don't have to scroll down on small screens to see what languages a project is written in.

To use this, install [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/), [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or another extension to load userscripts and follow their instructions on how to add a userscript like this.
